## Chrono24 Notebook

The Chrono24 notebook contains the codes used to scrape the Chrono24 website. Chrono24 is a secondary online market where users can sell and purchase luxury watches. For the purpose of the research two brands were scraped from the aformentioned website, namely Audemars Piguet and Cartier. For each respective brand the following information was retrieved:

- watch reference
- watch price
- watch conditions
- production_year
- case_diameter
- box_and_papers
- seller_location
- seller_rating.

The notebook is quite long because it includes different techniques used to try to scrape the information. At the end of the notebook there is a section titled 'Make Better'. The codes in this section were used for the final python script and consequentially for the scraping.
