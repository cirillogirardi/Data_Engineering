# Apache Airflow

This branch contains a python script and two pictures. 

## Final Watches

The python script 'final_watches' is the final script that was created utilizing the notebooks present within the other brances. The script was developed to automate the web scraping and data storage process in order to retrieve relevant information from different data sources, clean the data and further store it in an AWS S3 bucket. The script was developed for Apache Airflow and thus clearly delineates how and when each activity should be run. 

The results of the Airflow pipeline are stored on S3. 

## Apache Diagram and Tree

The two images Apache Diagram and Apache Tree, are screenshots from Apache Airflow respectively portraying the final graph and tree used to run the python script 'final_watches'.
