# Schema

## Data PySpark Notebook

The purpose of the notebook is twofold. The first part is dedicated to connecting to AWS RDS and uploading the relevant parquet files to the schema created. The second part of the notebook is dedicated to data analysis. Specifically, the second part is devoted to retrieving data from the RDS Database and applying machine learning models to test the usefulness of the data.

## Watches (SQL & PDF)

These files depict the schema that was utilised for the development of the AWS RDS database. The PDF version graphically depicts the schema and the connections between the tables, whilst the SQL file shows the sql code for the development of the schema.
